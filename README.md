# Tezpur University Android Malware Dataset (TUANDROMD)

[Dataset Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/855/tuandromd+(tezpur+university+android+malware+dataset))

##### This dataset is the preprocessed version of TUANDROMD. Therefore, it does not have any missing value and data split. Dataset contains 4465 instances and 241 attributes. The target attribute for classification is a category (malware vs goodware).

##### Three feature selection methods suitable for categorical data were applied. These are Information Gain, Chi-Squared Test and Univariate Feature Selection. Random Forest, a fast and high-performance algorithm, was used to compare the three methods. The dataset is splitted as train and test, with test_size=0.33. 
##### For these methods, the number of incorrectly predicted samples compared to different feature numbers is shown in the graph below.

##### As can be seen from the graph, the method that gave the best results was information gain. For this reason, the information gain method was preferred for Naive Bayes algorithms.


##### For the Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm, the K-Fold Cross Validation method for k = 4 was additionally applied. The aim is to reduce the possibility of overfitting the model during training. The results of the same evaluation metrics were considered for both applications. These are: Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve.
